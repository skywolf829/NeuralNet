# NeuralNet
During the summer of 2017, I created this as a introduction to neural networks, machine learning, and AI in general.

A neural network was coded to have any number of input nodes, output nodes, hidden layers, and size in each hidden layer.
This is supervised training, and I've only trained it on sin(x) and x. Threading was used to allow the cost to be visible
as the network is learning, allowing the user to stop whenever.
